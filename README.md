# rock_paper_scissors

A basic rock paper scissors game, but with a few extra features.

A while loop has been used to endlessly loop the game until the user exits the game. 

The sleep function from the time module has been used, to try and add some anticipation and create tension for the user when playing the game. 

A score has been kept and is updated and displayed every round, like a football game. 

Once game has been ended, exit messages are given where statistics are given on games won and overall result.
